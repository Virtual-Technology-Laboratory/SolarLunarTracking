Slide Projector
===============

SlideProjector.unitypackage contains a prefab of a Projector object with a
customized shader capable of projecting textures onto surfaces.

Placing the Projector
---------------------
The projector is intended to display thematic color maps on the terrain and is
oriented towards the ground. The x, z position cooresponds to the center of the 
projector. The projector is configured with an orthographic projection. The 
"Orthographic Size" specifies the radius.

For more details see: http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Projector.html


Shader and Material Details
---------------------------

To avoid tiling and other problems the slide image resources needs to:
   1. Have transparency along all four sides
   2. Be imported as "Advanced"
   3. Have wrap mode set to clamp
   4. Have generate mipmaps disabled
   
The addTransparentBorder.py script will add a transparent border to RGB and RGBA
images. 


Procedurally Slide Changes
--------------------------

Slides can be procedurally changed by setting the "_ShadowTex" texture of the 
projector's material.
 
 
Opacity Control
--------------------------
The opacity of the shader can specified by setting "_Opacity" on the
projector's material. The opacity should be between 0 and 1.
