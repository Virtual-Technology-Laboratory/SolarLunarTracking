Solar Lunar Tracking (Unity 5)
==============================

The SolarLunarTracking.unitypackage package for Unity 5 provides astronomically
accurate solar and lunar tracking. The tracking is used to position lights and 
objects representing the sun and moon. The color temperature of the sun light is 
adjusted as a function of elevation.

Getting Started
---------------
This project depends on the SimTimeControls package published by the VTL.

To use this package first add the SimTimeControls prefab to your scene. Then
place the SolarLunarTracking prefab in your scene. Position the prefab such that 
it is centered on your terrain.

In the inspector specify your location and UTM timezone in the fields provided 
under the "Solar Lunar Tracking Geolocation" component of the SolarLunarTracking 
GameObject.

In your lighting settings set the SolarLunarTracking/Sun/Light as the Sun. 
(Unity seems to forget this. If you can't see the Sun double check this.) 

Make sure the clipping distance of your main camera is beyond ~8000 meters to 
ensure the moon is visible. Or move the Plane under Moon to within your viewing
range. 

Changelog
---------
Updated to support Unity 5.1.1 API changes
