Solar Lunar Tracking (Unity 5)
==============================

The SolarLunarTracking.unitypackage package for Unity 5 provides astronomically
accurate solar and lunar tracking. The tracking is used to position the sun and
moon.

Getting Started
---------------------
This project depends on the SimTimeControls package published by the VTL.

To use this package first add the SimTimeControls prefab to your scene. Then
place the SolarLunarTracking prefab in your scene. Position the prefab such that 
it is centered on your terrain.

In the inspector specify your location and UTM timezone in the fields provided 
under the "Solar Lunar Tracking Geolocation" component of the SolarLunarTracking 
GameObject.

Make sure the clipping distance of your main camera is beyond ~8000 meters to 
ensure the moon is visible. Or move the Plane under Moon to within your viewing
range.
